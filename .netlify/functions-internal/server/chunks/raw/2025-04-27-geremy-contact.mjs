The machine observes the human body without mercy or indulgence, interpreting it as a deformed, grotesque mass viscerally emotional in its rawness.\\nWhat’s striking is how the AI avoids harmony, instead pouring into the body a sense of unease, anxiety, a nearly primal tension. There is no idealization, no redemption only flesh, wide eyes, and compressed gestures. In these figures, the AI doesn’t soften or console. It offers bodies that ask no forgiveness. Only presence. Only urgency.\",\"layout\":\"default\",\"subtitle\":\"“Every stroke is a threshold. Every body, an interior continent.
