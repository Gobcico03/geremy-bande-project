  The project The body as an island was born from the observation of seven
  different hands that deal with a single subject: the human body.

  Through a collection of life drawings made during collective sessions, the path highlights how each artist interprets the body according to his own visual language, his own gesture, his own sensitivity.


  The same body is traced, deformed, simplified, evoked: it becomes something else every time, while remaining recognizable.

  The site offers a living and poetic archive, where stylistic differences intertwine with emotional readings, thematic paths and reflections on the sign.

  A collection that does not seek a truth about the body, but seven ways of crossing it.


  "﻿Bodies that ask no forgiveness, this final collection is authored by AI. The machine observes the human body without mercy or indulgence, interpreting it as a deformed, grotesque mass viscerally emotional in its rawness.

  What’s striking is how the AI avoids harmony, instead pouring into the body a sense of unease, anxiety, a nearly primal tension. There is no idealization, no redemption only flesh, wide eyes, and compressed gestures. In these figures, the AI doesn’t soften or console. It offers bodies that ask no forgiveness. Only presence. Only urgency.
