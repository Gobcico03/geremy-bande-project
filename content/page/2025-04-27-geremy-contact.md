The project *The body as an island* was born from the observation of six different hands that deal with a single subject: the human body.\
Through a collection of life drawings made during collective sessions, the path highlights how each artist interprets the body according to his own visual language, his own gesture, his own sensitivity.

The same body is traced, deformed, simplified, evoked: it becomes something else every time, while remaining recognizable.\
The site offers a living and poetic archive, where stylistic differences intertwine with emotional readings, thematic paths and reflections on the sign.\
A collection that does not seek a truth about the body, but six ways of crossing it.
