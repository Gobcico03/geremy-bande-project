    This series was born as a visual outlet, a clear deviation from the academic
    conventions of life drawing. Here the body is no longer just anatomy to be
    studied: it is grotesque, disfigured, amplified — a container of internal
    tensions, of compressed anger, of imploding flesh.


    I chose this grotesque approach to force a truth that is more emotional than realistic. The subjects become deformed by excess, as if the soul were coming to the surface through muscular spasms, tense expressions, exasperated postures. The sign becomes violent, the line a scratch. The goal is not to arouse horror but visceral empathy: what is unpleasant to see is often what has long been hidden. The grotesque, then, is an act of honesty.
