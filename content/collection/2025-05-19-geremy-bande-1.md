  gallerytext: "This series observes the human body in its most unembellished,
    vulnerable form gestures caught mid-motion, faces folded in thought, limbs
    suspended in silent tension. Each drawing is not only a record of physical
    presence, but also a quiet revolt against perfection. The marks are swift,
    broken, hesitant at times like the breath of the sitter caught in ink and
    line. It’s a humble, almost devotional act of seeing: not to flatter, but to
    understand."
