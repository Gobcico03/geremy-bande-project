      caption: “Soft resistance.”
      text_below: A figure slumps, eyes closed behind glasses, the line almost
        hesitant as if unsure it has the right to define her.

      caption: “Still, turning.”
      text_below: Back to the viewer, hands gently held behind, the figure stands as
        if awaiting something wordless.

      caption: “Folded presence.”
      text_below: A dense scribble of brown pencil captures weight and posture, a body
        wrapped around itself, seated but not at ease.

      caption: “Clenched world.”
      text_below: Black ink carves out the hands on the head tension held not just in
        the body, but in thought.

      caption: “Curled like memory.”
      text_below: A pose of fetal gravity she turns inward, as if returning to herself
        beneath the ink’s edge.

      text_below: Drawn in charcoal gusts, the figure exhales into the void. The chair
        holds her body, the air holds her pause.
      caption: “Heavy breath.”
  gallerytext: "This series explores the body as an uncertain and living matter,
    shaken by internal tensions. The sign does not describe, but pursues. The
    figures do not offer themselves to observation, they elude. Each stroke
    searches for something that escapes: a balance, a thought, a corporeal truth
    that is never alone, but always also psychic. It is a fragmented and strong
    collection, where the drawing bends to the urgency of the gesture."
