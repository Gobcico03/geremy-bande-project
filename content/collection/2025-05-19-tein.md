        and questions form."

  gallerytext: "This collection is a visual and carnal explosion: the bodies are
    not only drawn, but *highlighted* , immersed in areas of acid light, cut out
    by theatrical shadows and defined by pulsating lines. Each stroke
    exaggerates the moment, each color enhances or contradicts. The sign is
    direct, decisive, but never loses the vital tension of the gesture. The
    environment is present but liquid, like a dream just remembered. There is a
    research on the body as an apparition, as an isolated and potential entity.
    Each figure is a short manifesto of its own existence."
