        surrender, framed by urgent lines and unapologetic color."

  gallerytext: "This series is a direct, chromatic, sometimes ironic exploration
    of the human body captured in its gravity and tiredness. The bright colors
    reds, electric blues, unnatural yellows  undermine the academic illusion and
    push the body towards a theatrical plane. The poses remain concrete, but
    speak with a saturated, charged visual language. Written sentences, absent
    glances, bold glimpses: everything suggests an emotional urgency, almost an
    ironically public intimacy. Some subjects show themselves, others withdraw.
    All, however, seem on the verge of giving up, or finding a new way of being
    in their own body."
