      text_below: One collapsed, the other reaching movement drawn like breath from
        the belly of the sketchbook.

        pastel rhythm.

        silence under graphite rain.

        presence flickers slow.

      text_below: Watched yet unaware, she becomes both stage and story soft light
        slipping over bare thought.
  gallerytext: This collection brings together a cycle of observations from life
    that move between tenderness and detachment. The female figures, often
    captured in the moment of stasis, are immersed in an atmosphere made of
    restrained color, unnatural but poetic lights, and everyday gestures
    transformed into silent icons. The body is dissected with a pencil or
    revealed with layers of color, as if each line wanted to touch something
    fragile and true. Some drawings evoke a sense of suspension, others convey a
    satisfied resignation. In all of them there hovers a careful intimacy, a way
    of looking that does not judge, but listens.
